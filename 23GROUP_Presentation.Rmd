# Methodology Overview

Our comprehensive approach to mangrove wetland monitoring and conservation in the Greater Bay Area incorporates three key methodological components:

1. **Wetland Plant Community Classification**
   - Remote sensing-based classification of mangrove species and communities
   - Multi-source data integration for accurate vegetation mapping

2. **Mangrove Wetland Carbon Storage Monitoring**
   - Assessment of carbon pools in soil and vegetation
   - Monitoring of carbon cycle processes and carbon storage accounting

3. **Wetland Damage and Restoration Identification**
   - Identification of degraded mangrove areas
   - Prioritization of restoration sites based on ecological health assessment

Each methodology employs advanced remote sensing, GIS, and field survey techniques to provide a holistic understanding of mangrove wetland ecosystems.
